# QANX token

## What is QANX?

QANX token is an ERC20/BEP20 compliant token optimized for trading on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) with customizable locking and vesting options included.

The QANX token is also prepared with a mapping designed to store Post-Quantum cryptography public key hashes, which will technically enable a direct migration from the ERC20 and BEP20 tokens to QANplatform's upcoming native mainnet units which will utilize PQ cryptography by default.
